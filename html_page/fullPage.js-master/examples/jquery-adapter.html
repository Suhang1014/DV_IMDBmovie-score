            <div class="intro_content">
                <p>In our daily life, there are thousands of movies released around the world every day.</p>
                <p>However, it is hard to know if it of high quality or low quality unless it has been released for a long time.</p>
                <p>But to watch the excellent movies the first time can be the best experience.</p>
                <p>In this data story, it analyzes 5000 movies data from IMDB and then gives some common features of high score English movies
                    that released between 2010-2016, which may help people to predict the quality of new movies before releasing.

                        <p>If we set 7.5 as a boundary score, we can get:</p>

                            <li>Female aged 30-44 prefer mystery,  music, romance and sport movies.</li>

                        <p>
                            It is worth to mention that The types of movies that female audiences like are significantly more diverse than male.
                            And to my surprise, in female audience, sport and thriller get higher average scores than other genres in every age group.

                        Next, the scatter plot gives information of the budgets and the scores of all the high score English movies
                        and using different colors to separate different genres. Each point represents a movie and each color stands for a genre.
                        Besides, this chart marks the minimum score, the maximum score and the average score of every genre.

                    <p>
                        Interaction: On the left side of the chart panel is the legend and the filter,
                        you can hide some data points to have a clear view of the distribution of data points of particular genres.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because the number of data points of some of the genres in high score movies are quite small,
                        it is unreasonable to speculate the relation between their budgets and scores.
                        Fortunately, after calculating the linear regression equation of each genre,
                        there is a relative strong positive relationship between budget and IMDB score of ACTION movies(The p-value of the trend line is 0.02).
